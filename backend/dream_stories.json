    "story": "In twilight's hush, where ancient trees did stand,\nA sovereign fair, the Forest Queen, did reign.\nHer realm, a verdant throne, where misty vapors clung,\nAnd whispers of the woods, in reverence, did bring.\n\nHer visage, pale as moonlight, shone serene,\nUntroubled by the tumult of the world unseen.\nHer tresses, raven-black, cascaded like the night,\nAnd on her brow, a circlet of silver moonlight.\n\nWith eyes, like forest pools, deep and mysterious too,\nShe gazed upon the trees, as if in quiet converse anew.\nHer lips, a rosebud's promise, curled into a gentle smile,\nAs if the secrets of the forest, she did, for a moment, while.\n\nThe trees, like sentinels of old, stood watchful and still,\nTheir branches, like outstretched arms, in reverence, did fill.\nThe rustling leaves, a soft susurrus, whispered low and sweet,\nAs if the forest's ancient heart, in harmony, did beat.\n\nThe Forest Queen, in contemplation, stood, lost in thought,\nAs if the whispers of the woods, a hidden truth, did bring to naught.\nHer presence, calm and peaceful, like a summer's day,\nDid soothe the savage breast, and chase the night's dismay.\n\nAnd I, a wanderer, in awe, did stand and gaze,\nUpon the Forest Queen, in wonder, lost in dazed amaze.\nFor in her eyes, a wisdom, ancient and serene, did shine,\nA wisdom that did whisper secrets, of the forest, divine.",
